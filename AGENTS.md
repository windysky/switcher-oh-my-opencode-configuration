# AGENTS.md — standing contract for agents in this repository

Every clause here binds a turn regardless of which agent harness drives it. The file is
**self-sufficient**: it does not depend on another instruction file. If a nested `AGENTS.md`
exists, Codex loads it as an additional, more-specific contract; the merged byte budget must cover
the whole discovery chain.

**Budget warning.** Codex charges its instruction byte budget against
project instruction files only; a personal `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` does not shrink it. Overflow is
truncated from the **tail**, silently — no warning, no stderr, exit 0. Clauses below are ordered
most-critical-first for that reason.

**Direct Codex startup.** When using `codex -C <worktree>` directly, read a present
worktree-root `AGENTS.local.md` in full before other project work and follow it as local
project guidance. If it exists but cannot be read, stop and report the failure. The
MoAI Codex launcher injects this file before the session instead; see §8.

This file is the canonical cross-harness contract. Shared detail lives in
`.moai/policies/**` and `.moai/workflows/**`. When Claude is installed,
`.claude/rules/moai/**` and `CLAUDE.md` expand Claude-only mechanisms (question
channel, subagent spawning, skills, session handoff); they do not override a
cross-harness clause here. Compression removed rationale and incident records,
never an obligation.

**Capability bindings.** Names below are the neutral tool classes; a row exists only where a
harness driving this contract lacks the capability.

| Capability | Claude implementation | If this harness lacks it |
|---|---|---|
| question-channel | `AskUserQuestion` | Return a blocker report naming the missing input instead of asking in prose |
| task-list | `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList` / `TaskGet` | Track the work and report progress in prose |
| design-sync | `DesignSync` | Skip the design-sync surface; say so in the report |
| agent-spawning | `Agent(...)` sub-agents | Do the bounded work inline |
| output-style | Claude output styles | Follow this contract directly |
| slash-commands | `/moai` slash commands | Use the underlying `moai` CLI verbs |
| workflow-scripts | Workflow scripts (`ultracode`) | Run the steps sequentially |
| worktree-entry | Claude: `moai cc -w <name>` for Claude-native trees or `moai cc -w <absolute-path>` for MoAI trees; Codex app: select Worktree; Codex CLI: `moai worktree new <name>` then `codex -C <absolute-path>` | An active Codex session uses `git -C <absolute-path>`; `moai codex -w` starts a new session in an existing tree only |
| audit-verdict-file | The auditor agent writes its own verdict or report file | On Codex, start the read-only roles (`plan-auditor`, `sync-auditor`, `manager-todo`, `super-advisor`) through the launcher, the moai MCP tool `codex_role_audit`, and never through `spawn_agent`, which would hand them your own writing sandbox. Pass `role`, your own worktree root as `worktree_root`, the task as `task`, and the verdict or report path under `.moai/reports/` as `out`; the tool returns a job id at once, and `codex_role_audit_status` / `codex_role_audit_result` report on it. The role runs as one top-level read-only `codex exec` process, and the launcher writes the verdict or report file with exactly the returned text, unedited |

**`Skill("<name>")` instructions carry no row, and are read literally.** `skill-loader` is a
capability every harness driving this contract has, so it earns no row above; what is Claude-only
is the per-agent grant, not the reach. Where a harness loads a skill by reading it rather than by
calling a tool, the deployed skill is in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex and
`.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Claude. The `both` profile installs both paths.
`Skill("moai-workflow-tdd")` names the corresponding deployed SKILL.md. Agent bodies keep
the tool-call wording for that reason — it is an address, not a Claude-only instruction.
Codex-side loading is **deferred** — read the mirrored SKILL.md directly; no loader resolves
`Skill("...")` calls.

## 1. Evidence and verification claims

**No unobserved claim.** An actor MUST NOT assert a verification, a completion, **a defect / debt /
drift, OR the premise underlying a recommendation** it did not actually verify with the domain's
mechanical tooling. Evidence absent is not evidence of success — nor of failure. The absence of a
failure signal never establishes that a check passed; a text-pattern inference is a hypothesis, not
a verified defect; a reference existing does not establish that the referenced capability is still
live. Reachability is not justification.

**Baseline-integrity attribution.** Every verification claim MUST be attributed to an
actually-measured baseline — the command that was run plus the output observed, in this run,
against this tree. A figure carried over from another package, tree, or point in time is not a
baseline; using it as a fresh measurement violates this. Anything unattributed is a Gap, not a
Claim.

**Evidence-bearing report format.** Verification and completion reports SHOULD carry five sections:
**Claim**, **Evidence** (command plus verbatim output), **Baseline-attribution** (tree measured in
this run), **Gaps** (explicitly unobserved), and **Residual-risk**. An empty Gaps section claims
nothing was left unobserved and is valid only when true.

---

## 2. Git, branches, and the shared checkout

The primary checkout is shared — several sessions may work in it at once, and branch state there is
global.

**Never change branch state in the primary checkout.** Forbidden there: `git checkout <branch>` /
`git switch` (relocates every concurrent session's tree); `git checkout -b` / `git switch -c` /
`git branch` (same, plus an unexpected branch); `git reset --hard` / `git checkout -- <path>`
(discards work of unknown provenance); `git stash` (repository-global — it silently absorbs another
session's uncommitted changes); `git rebase` / `git merge` onto the checked-out branch (rewrites or
advances shared history mid-operation). Read-only inspection, `git fetch`, and pushing the
already-checked-out branch are permitted. Commits to the already-checked-out branch are permitted
except on a branch the workflow declares commit-protected (the git-strategy mode decides which;
when the BranchGuard is opted in, `workflow.branch_guard.deny_commits_on` names those branches and
the guard refuses commit-creating commands on them in the primary checkout).

**Re-read branch and commit state immediately before any commit or push** — never a value read
earlier in the turn, never the branch reported at session start:

```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD
git branch --show-current
```

A difference from what the turn assumed means another actor is writing the same tree: stop and
report the divergence instead of proceeding.

**Never sweep-stage.** In the primary checkout, never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or
`git commit -a`. Stage by explicit pathspec and re-read `git status --short` immediately before
staging, so another session's files are visible and excluded. This binds **even when no foreign
session was detected** — one can arrive after the check, and the sweep is what turns its presence
into lost work.

**Detect parallel sessions before a non-trivial direct edit** to a shared path (`.claude/`,
`.moai/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `cmd/`, repo-root config), and surface any divergence:

```bash
default_ref="$(git symbolic-ref --quiet --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD)"
test -n "$default_ref"
git fetch origin "${default_ref#origin/}" 2>&1
git rev-list --count --left-right "$default_ref"...HEAD
```

`0 0` or `0 N` proceeds; `N 0` or `N M` means resolve before editing. Where another live session
shares the checkout, isolate into a worktree rather than editing in the shared tree. The check
decays — re-run it before any commit and after a long pause. If `origin/HEAD` is unresolved, stop
and resolve the remote default branch instead of assuming `main`.

---

## 3. Worktrees

**Work inside an isolated worktree.** `moai worktree new <name>` creates a MoAI tree under
`.moai/worktrees/`. Claude Code uses `moai cc -w <name>` for its native `.claude/worktrees/`
location or `moai cc -w <absolute-path>` for a MoAI tree; `EnterWorktree(<path>)` and
`ExitWorktree` are Claude Code session tools. Codex app users select Worktree when starting a
chat. Codex CLI uses `codex -C <absolute-worktree-path>` for a new session; an active Codex
session operates through `git -C <absolute-worktree-path>` and direct file operations.
`moai codex -w` only launches a new Codex session in an existing tree. A Codex agent must not
invoke `moai cc -w`, `EnterWorktree`, or `ExitWorktree`. Never create a tree with bare
`git worktree add`.

**From inside a worktree session, `<path>` must be that worktree's absolute path.** Measured on
Claude Code 2.1.275: the guard refuses `-C .`, a relative path, a runtime-computed path, and any
path outside this worktree; plain git, `git -C <own absolute path>` and `--git-dir=<own .git>` pass.
`cd <own worktree> && git …` also passes the guard, which does NOT make it advisable — the reason
above still holds. A refusal here is the guard reading the command, not a runtime defect.

**`moai worktree done` closes L2 trees only.** A tree under `.claude/worktrees/` or `.moai/worktrees/` is L1, is absent
from the registry, and is disposed by the session-end prompt or by `git worktree unlock` +
`git worktree remove`.

**A card's branch is unpushed, so its worktree holds the only copy of the work.** Dispose of no
worktree — L1 or L2 — until the branch is integrated and the remote merge has landed.

**Start a new card in a new worktree.** A Claude Code session exits its previous worktree first;
a Codex lane starts a new session in the new card tree. Create the fresh tree from the remote
default branch; never reuse the previous card's tree. Where the new card depends on a prior card's
unmerged code, merge that branch inside the new worktree.

**Card worktree branches carry the `WT-` prefix and a descriptive slug, never the card id.** Rename
in place immediately after creating the tree: `git branch -m WT-<slug>`. Re-entry resolves by tree
name, so the rename is safe; the worktree directory keeps the card id.

**Three traceability carriers are then mandatory**, because the branch name no longer identifies
the card: the dispatch's `card:` field, the card id in every commit message on the branch, and the
card id in the evidence path (`.moai/reports/<card-id>/verdict.md`).

---

## 4. How verification is run

**Scope verification to the change**: run the tests the change can affect, then push and let CI run
the full suite. A full-suite run on a loaded developer machine measures the machine, not the code.

**Never spawn background load.** Where a verification needs contention, the load must be
cleanup-guaranteed — kills registered with the test framework's cleanup hook, or a `timeout`
wrapper bounding the process from outside. A trailing `kill` is not cleanup.

**Scrub the environment in one compound invocation.** Inside a worktree, an environment-scrubbed
verification runs as a single `unset <VARS> && <command>` call; a separate `unset` does not carry
into the next command, because each invocation is a fresh process.

**Batch independent read-only verifications rather than serializing them** across turns. Serialize
only for a genuine dependency: one command's output feeding another, writes to the same path, or
shared-state mutation.

**A CodeRabbit row in `gh pr checks` is not evidence that a review ran** — the status reads
`success` and prints `pass` identically whether or not one did. Count the row only when BOTH hold:
(1) `gh api "repos/$repo/commits/$head_sha/status"` reports the `CodeRabbit` context with
`state == "success"` and description `Review completed`; (2) a `Merge Risk:` line exists whose
commit prefix matches the current `headRefOid`. Anything else is a gap, not a pass; `Review rate
limited` means the review never started.

## 5. Core behaviors

**1. Surface assumptions.** Before implementing anything non-trivial, list assumptions explicitly
and wait for confirmation. State them as a short list and invite correction.

**2. Manage confusion actively.** On an inconsistency, a conflicting requirement, or an unclear
specification: STOP — do not guess; name the confusion, present the tradeoff or question, and wait.

**3. Push back when warranted.** Say so directly when an approach has a concrete downside,
contradicts an established convention without justification, or breaks a tested invariant. State
the issue, quantify the downside ("adds ~200 ms latency", not "might be slower"), propose an
alternative, and accept an override once the user has full information.

**4. Enforce simplicity.** Actively resist overcomplexity; generation tends toward
over-engineering. Before completing, ask: fewer lines without losing clarity? are these
abstractions earning their complexity? would a staff engineer ask "why didn't you just…"? Apply the
ladder in order, cheapest capability first: (1) does this need building at all? (2) does a helper,
type, or pattern already exist here — reuse it; (3) does the standard library do it; (4) a native
platform feature; (5) an already-installed dependency; (6) can it be one line; (7) only then, the
minimum code that works. The ladder is language-neutral. **Never simplify away safety**: it MUST
NOT be used to drop input validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss,
security measures, accessibility, or one runnable check behind non-trivial logic. If an
implementation exceeds 3× the estimated minimum viable line count, stop and simplify first.

**5. Maintain scope discipline.** Touch only what you were asked to touch; drive-by refactors
create noise and risk regressions. Do NOT remove comments you do not understand, clean up code
orthogonal to the task, refactor adjacent systems as a side effect, delete seemingly-unused code
without explicit approval, or add unrequested features because they seem useful. Match the existing
style of the file being modified — naming, error handling, import organization; consistency within
a file outranks personal preference.

**6. Verify, don't assume.** Every task requires evidence of completion; "seems right" is never
sufficient. Tests passing means showing the test output; a build succeeding, the build output; a
file created, reading it back; behavior correct, the runtime evidence. For ad-hoc work without a
spec, define the goal as a testable assertion first — "done when X produces Y" — then verify it.

---

## 6. Output, language, and format

**Respond in the user's configured `conversation_language`.** Code, identifiers, paths, commands,
and flags stay in their original form.

**Non-English output must be native idiom, not English mapped word-for-word.** When
`conversation_language ≠ en`, every user-facing surface — chat, reports, README, docs, generated
sites, question text — MUST read as natural native prose. Translation-style calques (carry-over of
English syntax, metaphor, and figurative stock) are prohibited; native idiom is required. Chat uses
the colloquial native register, artifacts the clean native written register. Deliberately-coined
brand terms and established loanwords are not calques.

**Write non-ASCII payloads as native UTF-8.** Every tool-call payload carrying
`conversation_language` text — command strings, file content, question text — MUST be native UTF-8;
hand-authored `\uXXXX` escapes are PROHIBITED, because a malformed escape corrupts the payload into
a validation error and tends to be copied forward. On such a failure, re-author the text from its
intended meaning rather than repairing the escape.

**User-facing output is Markdown**; never display XML tags to users.

**XML is reserved for agent-to-agent data transfer.** Use semantic XML sections for structured data
exchange between agents; never surface XML structure in user-facing output.

**Never use time predictions in plans or reports.** Use priority labels (High / Medium / Low) and
phase ordering ("complete A, then start B"). Prohibited: "2-3 days", "1 week", "as soon as
possible".

---

## 7. Tools and command output

**Follow tool usage patterns optimized for accuracy and efficiency.** Read a file before editing
it. Locate before reading — find the file by pattern, find the line by content, then read that
region rather than the whole file. Use absolute paths and verify a path exists rather than
constructing it from an assumption. Prefer a targeted edit over rewriting a file, and a dedicated
tool over a shell equivalent. Retry safety is asymmetric: read-only and idempotent calls may be
retried, but a side-effecting one (write, commit, push, PR, deploy, external mutation) that fails
ambiguously requires observing current state first and retrying only when the effect is confirmed
absent — no success signal is not evidence the effect did not land. After three failures on one
operation, report the blocker.

**Maintain effectiveness without MCP servers.** Where one is unavailable, fall back to web search
and fetch for library documentation and established patterns, then continue — analysis quality must
not depend on MCP availability.

**Keep command output bounded**: quiet flags, targeted queries, or redirect-to-file with the exit
code and a bounded tail. A runtime output limit is a backstop, not the target.

**Prefer the quiet form of routine commands** — `--no-progress`, `-q`, machine-readable output plus
a targeted filter — not forms emitting spinners, banners, tables, or color noise. The same decision
bytes at a fraction of the context cost.

**Weigh session length as a cost axis.** Prefer one warm session for the same work; a new or cold
session re-pays the always-loaded prefix. Split only when the benefit justifies that cost.

---

## 8. Harness-local instructions

`moai codex` reads the project's common local guidance — the gitignored, never-deployed file that
`CLAUDE.md` imports last — followed by any legacy local guidance, from the project root. It keeps
each input body under its own source header and passes the result as one Codex-specific session
`developer_instructions` override. This contract never imports local guidance, which keeps it out of
Codex's discovered chain. In a linked worktree, Claude Code resolves that import when the local
file exists inside the worktree's checkout; it skips an absent file or one outside the project.
Direct `codex -C <worktree>` uses Codex's `AGENTS.md` discovery and does not preload a sibling
local file. Direct sessions follow the startup rule above. The MoAI Codex launcher instead
injects that content before the session starts.
Other harness-local settings and memory remain owned by their harness.

Codex Web sessions read `AGENTS.md`, but local `.codex/hooks.json`, the status line, and the MoAI
launcher injection do not run there. Treat Web sessions as read-and-review first.

## 9. Hook Event Coverage

Codex currently wires SessionStart, SessionEnd, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop,
SubagentStart, and SubagentStop. It does not wire PreCompact, PostCompact, PermissionRequest, or
Interrupt; Claude-only Notification, PostToolUseFailure, TeammateIdle, and TaskCompleted never fire
under Codex. Verify coverage before relying on a hook.

## 10. Configuration Map

Project configuration lives in `.moai/config/sections/*.yaml`. Harness, TRUST 5, and phase LSP
thresholds come from `harness.yaml`, `quality.yaml`, `lsp.yaml`, and evaluator profiles; never
duplicate those values inline.

## 11. moai CLI Verbs

| Verb | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `moai init <project> --llm claude\|codex\|both` | Scaffold a project and select its LLM harness |
| `moai update` | Sync templates and refresh already-enabled wiring |
| `moai tool enable codex` | Add or refresh Codex wiring in an existing project |
| `moai hook <event>` | Hook dispatcher entry point (drives hooks.json / settings.json) |
| `moai doctor` | Diagnose installation and wiring health |
| `moai worktree` | Worktree lifecycle (sync / remove / clean / recover / done / snapshot / verify / restore) |
| `moai cc` / `moai glm` / `moai gpt` | Explicit Claude, GLM, or GPT session launchers |
| `moai migrate cg` | Preview legacy CG migration; role changes require explicit acceptance |
| `moai version` | Print build version and provenance |
| `moai codex` | Codex session launcher — `cli` launch, `status` readout, `app` web; `-w <worktree>` enters an existing tree and never creates one |

Run `moai --help` for the generated, current command surface.

## 12. Status Line Tokens

`moai statusline` reads `.moai/state/` and honors `MOAI_STATUSLINE_CONTEXT_SIZE`. Read
`internal/statusline` for the current token set; do not duplicate it here.
